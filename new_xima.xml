			<description><![CDATA[<p>Global View ‐ Nationalities (C0263)<br>A: Hey! How was your first day of class? I’m in level two and I’m loving my class this semester! It’s great being in a class of international students!<br>B: Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester.<br>A: That’s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’s the United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we also have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians!<br>B: That’s quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.<br>A: Well, I think you’re pretty lucky actually. You’ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.<br>B: I guess so, but I think it’s going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes.<br>A: Don’t! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.<br>B: I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.<br>A: Well, there is that, yes.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798153">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798153</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Daily Life ‐ Toothache (C0264)<br>A: What seems to be the problem?<br>B: I have a really bad toothache! My cheek is swollen and I can’t eat anything.<br>A: Let’s have a look. Hmmm. This doesn’t look too good. I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth. It’s pressing against your molars and that’s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.<br>B: When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?<br>A: First we will take some x-rays and see what we’re dealing with. I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.<br>B: I guess that’s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.<br>A: It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets. In any case, I’ll administer an anesthetic and you won’t feel a thing!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798154">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798154</a></p>]]>

These bugs are driving us crazy!<br>A: What sort of pest are we dealing with?<br>B: We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything. We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard!<br>A: Well, there’s nothing we can’t handle. I’ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to get rid of. We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it. Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.<br>B: No problem, just get rid of the bugs!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798155">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798155</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Daily Life ‐ Weather Report (C0266)<br>A: Those are today’s top stories. Now let’s go to John for the weather. John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?<br>B: I’m afraid we’re in for a rough weekend, Mark. There is a storm system moving through the East Coast. It will be drizzling all day today, and there’s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening. It will be warm and humid all weekend. In the Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.<br>A: That’s pretty chilly for the summer! Will it rain on Saturday?<br>B: Unfortunately, yes. It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day. There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast. Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls.<br>A: That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.<br>B: It gets better on Sunday, though. The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night. It will still be rather cool, with highs in the low 50s. The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather, but at least the sun will come out. I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving. Back to you, Mark.<br>A: Thanks John, and there you have it! Looks like it’s a weekend to stay at home!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798156">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798156</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Purchasing Manager (C0268)<br>A: Good morning, Angela, how have you been lately?<br>B: Morning, Michael. I’ve been very busy lately. One of our other vendors is going out of business and I’ve been searching for a suitable replacement.<br>A: Well, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run sit down. Coffee?<br>B: No, thanks. I’ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .<br>A: Haha, I could never do that. I’d be a zombie if I didn’t have my morning coffee fix. Let’s get down to business then.<br>B: Yes. I’ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new MePhone. The demand for phone cameras is growing, and Pear has been falling behind in the market.<br>A: That’s great! I’m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon. Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras. Is Pear still interested in having those?<br>B: No, we’re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels. We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal.<br>A: Surely. Let’s get started by drafting a new contract.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798158">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798158</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Marketing Plan (C0269)<br>A: Okay everyone, let’s begin. I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession. I wanted to re-emphasize our corporate mission of Aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.<br>B: Several other shops have reduced the prices for their coffees and are drawing in more customers. Why aren’t we doing the same thing?<br>A: I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the level of our competitors. We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than shortterm sales. If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.<br>B: Customers don’t care about the coffee anymore. They only care about the price.<br>A: I disagree. Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places. Our coffee bean are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees. When you compare the coffees side-by-side our coffee wins the taste test every time. We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now.<br>C: That’s true. We’ve certainly achieved top of mind awareness when it comes to the best best tasting brews and it’s important to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. I think the main question is how we can show our appreciation to our customers.<br>A: That’s the main question I would like to discuss today.<br>B: Money is tight for everyone these days so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee. Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies why don’t we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home.<br>C: That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?<br>A: Let’s brainstorm some more ideas, and do some research. The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets. Maybe it’s time we started selling coffee beans.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798159">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9798159</a></p>]]>

So how’ve you been? Settling into college life OK?<br>A: Yeah, I think so! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I’m living atthe frat house now.<br>B: Oh, so you’re a frat boy now, huh?<br>A: Yeah, yeah, I know, it’s totally clich ´ e, but really, I think it’s been a good decision. I’ve got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys. What about you? What have you been up to?<br>B: Not much. I’m still living at home and commuting to school. I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about. It just wasn’t as interesting as I’d hoped. The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.<br>A: That sounds smart. . . but kind of boring.<br>B: Yeah, it is, a little bit. I joined the Great Outdoors Club, though, which has been a lot of fun. We’ve gone on two camping trips already, and I’ve made some good friends.<br>A: That’s cool.

I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction.<br>A: Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way. I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.<br>B: I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.<br>A: I will bring it up over Sunday brunch.<br>B: Good luck with that!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9797955">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9797955</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Weekend ‐ Bowling (C0305)<br>A: Alright, so the first thing that you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.<br>B: Why not?<br>A: Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down. If you step there you will slip and fall.<br>A: OK, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard, so now, how the heck do I play this?<br>A: You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins. If you do, that is called a strike. If you don’t knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare. After ten frames, we add up the points and see who has the most. Three hundred is a perfect score, but very hard to get.<br>B: Got it! OK, I’m gonna give it a go. Oh no! My ball went in the gutter!<br>A: I told you, its harder than you think.

I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.<br>B: Yeah. Also, we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven. Since you don’t use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop upthe curry or rice.<br>A: What about veggies?<br>B: They have a good variety of vegetable based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas or Daal.<br>A: It all sounds exquisite!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ First Paycheck (C0317)<br>Emily: Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck.<br>Susan: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.<br>Emily: Well, this is my first paycheck here inthe States and there are a few things I don’t understand. First off, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan?<br>Susan: OK, let’s start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay.<br>Emily: Yes, that’s easy enough to understand.<br>Susan: Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It’s your federal income tax. And then there’s Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.<br>Emily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn’t actually a health insurance I can use now.<br>Susan: That’s right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There’s the state income tax, and then this SUI SDItax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it’s a pretty small quantity that they take.<br>Emily: Yeah, I don’t mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes – one at a state level and one at a federal level?<br>Susan: That’s right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.<br>Emily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.<br>Susan: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody’s net pay is as high as they’d like. I can understand why you’d want some explanation.<br>Emily: Yeah, I guess it’s the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9797656">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9797656</a></p>]]>

They tell you general and obvious<br>things like that you will be successful or have a big house. I think most of the times they are just scam artists.<br>A: Well historically it is a practice that many cultures share. Reading the tarot cards, in the east they would even read tea leaves!

I will call you later, so leave me your name and number”.<br>B: That’s more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.<br>A: Ok, so how about this, “ This is Abby and I am really happy you called! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number. Talk to you soon!”.<br>B: A little too friendly Abby. Just say this, “ Hi, you have reached Abby.

Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?<br>B: The brain!<br>A: That’s right the brain! It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition. Then what major organ is in our chest?<br>B: The heart!<br>A: Very good! It pumps blood throughout the body, using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins. Now let’s not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive! Now what about the organs that help us digest food?<br>B: The stomach and intestines!<br>A: Very good! Let’s not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste. Are we forgetting anything?<br>B: Yeah! Our kidneys, liver and bladder!<br>A: Oh yes, you are right. Very important organs indeed.<br>B: So what do these organs do teacher?<br>A: Well, ummm, they...Time for a break!

Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit.<br>B: Got it.<br>A: No we are gonna make the batter. Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency. Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.<br>B: Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer?<br>A: Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed. I’m gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.<br>B: Ok, so now we need a baking pan right?<br>A: Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won’t stick to it when it bakes.<br>B: Done. So how long do we bake it for?<br>A: We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes. Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.<br>B: Wow!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Global View - All About Wines (C0346)<br>Salesperson: Hello there, welcome to WineWorld. Let me know if I can help you out at all.<br>Customer: Um, yes, please, I could really use some help. I’m going over to my boss’ house for dinner tonight and don’t know what kind of wine I should bring.<br>Salesperson: OK, do you know what kind of food will be served?<br>Customer: Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi.<br>Salesperson: Hmm, that’s a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let’s see. have to be a white wine, of course.<br>Customer: Why? Wouldn’t a red wine go well with sushi?<br>Salesperson: No, I don’t think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish.<br>Customer: I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That’s a white wine, right?<br>Salesperson: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I’m not sure it’d be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I’d suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.<br>Customer: Sauvignon Blanc? What’s that?<br>Salesperson: That’s another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.<br>Customer: Let’s see. The label says it’s got ”attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bonedry finish. Serve chilled.” Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I’m on my way to the dinner now.<br>Salesperson: It’s OK, don’t worry, we’ll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don’t have quite as extensive a selection over here, but...this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.<br>Customer: All right. What varietal is that?<br>Salesperson: Well, this is a French wine, so they don’t always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I’d guess.<br>Customer: And you think this is a good wine?<br>Salesperson: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It’s not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it’s more approachable. It’s light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.<br>Customer: Perfect! I’ll take it!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9797685">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9797685</a></p>]]>

So what do they do to you at your beauty spa?<br>A: Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin. Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young. Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.<br>B: That doesn’t really sound like something I would be interested in.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Global View - Chinese Medicine (C0349)<br>A: What’s wrong?<br>B: I have a headache. These past few days I’ve been living off painkillers. Man, I feel like my head is going to explode.<br>A: You should get acupuncture treatment. My mom was always having headache issues and it was<br>acupuncture that cured her.<br>B: The results are too slow. On top of that, just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me.<br>A: They don’t just randomly stick you, they find your pressure points. The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment, restoring the body’s ”chi”.<br>B: But I get scared the moment I see a needle. How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end?<br>A: The needles are very thin, and as long as the doctor’s technique is good, and the patient himself is relaxed, it won’t hurt–on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain. Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin; they don’t hurt at all. However, if you are really scared of acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also options.<br>B: Scraping is too terrifying. When they finish scrapping, your body is all red, as if you were just tortured. Cupping is the same, your body ends up with red circles all over it–looks like someone beat you up.<br>A: This only signifies that the toxins have left the body. Actually, there is only discomfort during the treatment process. Once it’s over you feel very comfortable.<br>B: Chinese medicine is strange. The patients are already ill, and then the doctor makes them suffer more.<br>A: This is the only way to get at the problem. Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain,You are just going to have to be tough and do it.<br>B: Forget it. I don’t want to inflict any more pain on myself. In a little while I’ll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9797688">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9797688</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Global View ‐ Contraceptives (C0252)<br>A: Alright, settle down everyone. As part of this school’s curriculum we’ll be covering sex ed this week.<br>A: Now I want everyone to take this class seriously, sexual education is very important and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of. Remember, there are no stupid questions here.<br>B: Miss Carlton? What exactly is sexual education? Are you going to teach us like Kama sutra stuff like that?<br>A: No Jason, that’s not exactly what sex ed is. Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how the male and female bodies work.<br>B: My older sister is in college and she takes what she and her friends call the pill. I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.<br>A: Good point Jason! This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives. As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist. The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STD’s from an infected person. Another popular method is using condoms. This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant but also protects both from STD’s. Yes Jason?<br>B: What are condoms made out of? How exactly is it that a woman gets pregnant?<br>A: Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called Latex. As for your other question, that’s a whole new class.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475962">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475962</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Global View ‐ The Miracle Of Life (C0255)<br>A: Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life. Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I am sure that some of the things that we will be talking about today may surprise you. Billy can you turn on the projector please? Thanks. Ok, does anyone know what this is?<br>B: Looks like a goat head to me!<br>A: Nice try, but this is a woman’s womb which contains her uterus and ovaries. The ovaries. are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of your cycle. In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days, counting day 1 as the first day of your last period.<br>B: That’s amazing! So each month, the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?<br>A: Actually, every woman is already born with over four hundred thousand eggs! Some will start dying off immediately and others released during her fertile period.<br>B: What about the guys? I know they produce sperm and stuff.<br>A: That’s right! The man’s body has a tiny factory that produces sperm twenty four hours a day! Each ejaculation will release about a hundred million sperm so the factory is always pretty busy. The sole purpose of a sperm’s life is to fertilize the woman’s egg.<br>B: So, then we basically need to put one-and-one together so we can have babies right?<br>A: Yes, the man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen. Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix, through the uterus to the fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere from forty five minutes to twelve hours! Not all of them make it, since some go the wrong way and get lost or simply die. Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside.<br>B: And then? That’s it?<br>A: Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release. The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing. The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus. Any other questions? Then let’s move on.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475965">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475965</a></p>]]>

This doesn’t include a generous housing allowance also.<br>Rebecca: I understand. And are there other bonuses included?<br>Mr. Parsons: Well apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers.

Don’t you know what day it is?<br>A: Ummm. no.<br>B: It’s only the day when the world’s biggest sporting event is kicking off.<br>A: What?<br>B: The World Cup! The first match is today! It’s Mexico vs. South Africa! It’s going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, and all.<br>A: I have no idea what you’re talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.<br>B: This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, each group having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarterfinalsand semifinals.<br>A: Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn’t really appeal to me.<br>B: Are you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup! It’s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion. So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt; they’re really good!<br>A: All I know about soccer is that you can’t use your hands and that players are always falling down, trying to get a free kick or penalty kick. It seems like a sissy sport to me!<br>B: Whatever dude, I’m going to go watch the opening match.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475967">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475967</a></p>]]>

You mean to fire a real weapon? I don’t know man.<br>B: Yeah it will be fun! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot. I also have a revolver that’s really fun too! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.<br>A: Yeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile! Or what about a flame thrower!<br>B: Whoa, take it easy there Rambo. Don’t get carried away. These weapons are not toys, and you must first learn how to handle them properly. There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe. For example, never handle a weapon that you haven’t inspected yourself. Always make sure there isn’t anything in the chamber, and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot!<br>A: Wow, I didn’t know! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies!<br>B: The reality is different you know, running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies!

She can also help you do some household chores, and run some errands.<br>Mel: Oh, I don’t know... it’s hard to find the right nanny .You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone to help me out, though.<br>Grace: I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won’t have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you’ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to work for my neighbors, before they moved away. She’s very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.<br>Mel: Oh, that’s great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I’ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow.

My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and that I will have a passionate summer fling!<br>Angela: What are you talking about? Let me see that. . . What are horoscopes?<br>Lydia: It’s a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I’m an Aries. When were you born?<br>Angela: January 5th.<br>Lydia: Let’s see. . . you’re a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we’ll both have interesting summers!<br>Angela: That’s bogus. I don’t feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.<br>Lydia: No it’s not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. Angela: Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?<br>Lydia: A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. * laughs * That sounds just like you!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475974">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475974</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 2 ‐ Talking about<br>numbers, charts and graphs (C0274)<br>Mr Ford: As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.<br>Mr Ford: We continue to fight with our competitors for market share, and this is the case both in the developed markets in the West, as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.<br>Mr Ford: You may ask yourself, why is this market so cut-throat? Well the answer is simple. There is a huge untapped potential market out there ,with a huge untapped<br>potential for profit.<br>Mr Ford: If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.<br>Mr Ford: As you can see in the 1980’s computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world population. Since the 1990’s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.<br>Mr Ford: In the new millennium we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners , with figures rising to around 4- 5%, an increase of 1000 % percent compared with the 1980’s .<br>Mr Ford: If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically we can see in Chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.<br>Mr Ford: Now of course 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China, and this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.<br>Mr Ford: For us at Alpha, and of course for all our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.<br>Mr Ford: If we do this right we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame. I’d now like to move on to discuss the x420 brand itself, and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475975">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475975</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 3 ‐ Making Comparisons (C0277)<br>Mr. Ford: Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new x420 line with our previous models, and also of course with some of our competitors.<br>Mr. Ford: In other words what makes the x420 stand out from all the others? This is a key question, and is something I’d like to explore in a little depth. Firstly, the x420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.<br>Mr. Ford: The first thing to mention is that the x420 is the first in a new generation of ultralight laptop computers. It is only 2lbs, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors. In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine it’s very powerful. 4Gb of RAM, with an ultra-fast processor.<br>Mr. Ford: The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal-clear 15-inch LCD display. The x420 really stands out as next generation laptop. Compared with our previous x540 range it really is in a league of its own .<br>Mr. Ford: Now, if we go on to look at projected sales for the x420 we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least 20 million dollars. Now this is really a conservative estimate.<br>Mr. Ford: If our marketing campaign is successful I’m confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least. Now please bear in mind that this is only for<br>the first year of production.<br>Mr. Ford: I’m certain that in the coming three years the x420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue. Okay, now let’s move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475978">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475978</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 4 ‐ Discussing the<br>Competition (C0280)<br>Mr. Ford: Now, of course, with all this cutting-edge technology there must be a catch, you might ask yourself. I bet the retail price will be too much for most consumers, you might say. Well, you’d be wrong!<br>Mr. Ford: Yes, of course the x420 is aimed at the luxury market, but if you compare the price of our leading competitors, the x420 represents incredible value for money. At only15,000RMB it is far more affordable and far more attractive than almost every leading brand and model.<br>Mr. Ford: So, what differentiates us from our competitors? Well, if we compare Orange’s luxury MP40 range then we can really highlight some of the differences.<br>Mr. Ford: Now, of course Orange has an enviable record for producing revolutionary and top class products, and I must admit the MP40 is a breathtaking machine. However, for most consumers the MP40 is simply far too expensive to consider.<br>Mr. Ford: Compared with the x420 it is more expensive and there’s no doubt that considering the quality and workmanship that goes into the x420 we really win hands down on value for money.<br>Mr. Ford: Also, if you compare the after sales service we offer I think we can proudly boast the best customer service facilities in the whole lap-top sector. As opposed to most of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we guarantee service and we guarantee reliability.<br>Mr. Ford: The questions we must ask ourselves are ” What does the Alpha brand stand for? and also ” How can we set ourselves apart from our competitors? The answer to both of these questions is the same my friends.<br>Mr. Ford: Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence and for service. If we always stick to this philosophy then I’m confident that we will really be able to expand our market share significantly. Okay, let me move on now to give you an idea of our marketing campaign for the x420</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475981">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475981</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Global View ‐ Physics (C0282)<br>Prof. Brown: Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Physics 101. My name is Ed Brown, and I will be your professor for this semester. Since today is our first class, I wanted to give you an overview of what this course will look like, how you will be graded, and what we will cover this semester.<br>Matt: Will we be focusing more on theoretical physics or experimental physics, Professor?<br>Prof. Brown: This is an introductory course, and my aim is to give you a broad overview of the field of physics. The term “ physics” encompasses many different areas of research and study, and I hope this course will provide you with conceptual understanding of physics, which will prove useful whether or not you choose to further your study in this field.<br>Prof. Brown: We will begin the course by looking at the fundamental concepts of physics, then by the middle of the semester we will begin exploring the more theoretical side of physics. It is essential that you first have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, so that you can better understand the theoretical concepts when we get to them. Matt: Will we learn about black holes, wormholes, and string theory?<br>Prof. Brown: We will learn about the general theory of relativity, including black holes. We will also explore developing theories in quantum mechanics, such as string theory. We will discuss some hypothetical features of space-time, like wormholes.<br>Prof. Brown: We will also explore some of the more influential developments in the fields of thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and nuclear physics, all of which have had significant impacts on modern life. Now, I am going to have the TAs pass out the syllabus for this class, so you can see how this course will be graded.<br>Matt: Oh man, looks like this isn’t gonna be the easy A I thought it’d be!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475983">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475983</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 5 ‐ Deferring Questions (C0283)<br>Mr. Ford: Now, as we have already discussed there is a huge untapped market out there both in Asia, in other developing markets, and in the more mature markets for us to push into. Now of course, this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners, but for any new product we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign<br>Mr. Ford: It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer, and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level. The question we must first address is of course, who is our target consumer and secondly what do they expect from the next generation Alpha lap-top?<br>Mr. Ford: Let’s first of all tackle the first question. Our target consumer for the x420 is the middle class, white collar worker with an above average income. However, as we mentioned before the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly and we need to broaden our audience for this product.<br>Mr. Ford: For example, the x420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector, who might use laptops both for study and gaming. There is no doubt that.<br>Audience Member: Mr. Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment. You say that the computer is suitable for students, but don’t you think the price of the x420 is just too much for most students?<br>Mr Ford: Well, that’s a fair point. If you don’t mind I’d like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q and A section. Is that okay?<br>Audience Member: Yes sure.<br>Mr Ford: Okay, so as I was saying we have an exciting campaign planned for the x420. Firstly, we will have a nationwide television campaign, as well as advertising on radio and also in many computer publications. We also intend to.<br>Audience Member: I’m sorry to stop you Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost effective. I mean, how much is that going to cost?<br>Mr Ford: Well I don’t have the figures to hand, but I’d be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation. Okay let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475984">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475984</a></p>]]>

When was the last time you had a tune up?<br>B: Not that long ago, I think it was four months ago.<br>A: We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers.<br>B: Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?<br>A: First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter. If you don’t do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.<br>B: I see. What else?<br>A: We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid. We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.<br>B: Ok, well, when you put it that way, it doesn’t seem like a waste of time and money.<br>A: Trust me, regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475985">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475985</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 6 ‐ Addressing the<br>Audience (C0286)<br>Mr. Ford: The campaign that we have in store for the x420 is exciting, imaginative and revolutionary. We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.<br>Mr. Ford: I would like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you we really could not have devised this campaign. I’d like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you’ve done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in your continuing your commitment to Alpha computers.<br>Mr. Ford: There’s no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here and together we can really push Alpha computers to a whole new level of success.<br>Mr. Ford: On the subject of the campaign let me ask you all a question. How do we define the perfect lap-top? Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability? What do you look for in a consumer? Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.<br>Mr. Ford: Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the x420 is a state-ofthe-art laptop for all of your computing needs. With our television campaign we hope to really reach out to a huge audience. Mr. Ford: We have a great ad campaign planned focusing on the fantastic USP’ s of the x420. We have hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign, and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the x420.<br>Mr. Ford: I’m excited to say that today, for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475987">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475987</a></p>]]>

They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.<br>B: Yeah but, it is something that you will have forever!

I thought they just paint it on your skin or something.<br>B: I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough round the edges. Okay, so. just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen...<br>Mr. Ford: Hmmmmmm. Sorry about this. Bear with me me a second. There seems to be a problem with the projector. Let me see. could you lend a hand a second? Jonathan: It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer. Let me check the connection a second... Well the connection seems okay, and the computer is running normally.<br>Mr. Ford: Okay. Sorry guys. Obviously a problem with the system. Let’s just reboot and start over. Let’s see if this resolves the issue.<br>Jonathan: Right, lets try again. No, still nothing Michael. There might be a technical issue with the projector. I think maybe the projector has overheated. We might need to cool it down for ten minutes and start again. I’ll call IT support to come over right now.<br>Mr. Ford: Okay guys. Unfortunately technical problems do crop up from time to time, don’t they? But it’s not a huge problem. In the meantime while the IT guys get to work on that I can talk a little bit more about the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475990">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475990</a></p>]]>

I’m completely at a loss.<br>Shop assistant: Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings, or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant. What<br>is her favorite gemstone?<br>Mark: That purple one.

But...I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?<br>Shop assistant: We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could also get her a locket.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 8 ‐ Common Presentation Mistakes (C0292)<br>Mr. Ford: So as I mentioned previously the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop: affordability, quality, speed and reliability. We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.<br>Mr. Ford: Actually, just to illustrate my point let me give you an anecdote here. I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers. It was a lovely summer afternoon. Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf, and wanted to get his input on the new x420.<br>Mr. Ford: Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf. It really is a wonderful way to relax. To be honest, I’m not that great at golf, but I have improved in the last few years. But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice. I’ve lost my thread. What was I talking about again?<br>Jonathan: I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement Michael.<br>Mr. Ford: Yes, excuse me. I’m afraid I got sidetracked there. Yes anyway, the campaign. Well, erm. let me see. Is the projector working yet Jonathan?<br>Jonathan: No sorry, IT are still fixing it.<br>Mr. Ford: Ahh okay, erm... all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint. I haven’t actually got my notes with me...ermlet me see, erm.....<br>Audience Member: Mr. Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign? When are the first advertisements scheduled for?<br>Mr. Ford: That’s a good question. Unfortunately I erm...don’t have that information on me. I will have to get back to you on that point.<br>Jonathan: Okay Michael, the projector is fixed. I think we’re ready.<br>Mr. Ford: Thank goodness. Okay everyone, sorry for the delay. So without further ado the new x420 marketing campaign! Enjoy! oh ermmm. I’m terribly sorry, this is not the advert, this is my golfing holiday in Barbados. I think I must have brought the wrong file. Can we take five?</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475993">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475993</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Advanced Media ‐ Cheese Lovers (F0293)<br>A: Hello everyone my name is Laurie and I want to welcome you to this course. We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet; cheese! Let’s get started!<br>A: Cheese is usually categorized intofour types: soft, semi- soft semi-hard and hard. The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese, which directly affects its texture. Making cheese is an ancient practice, dating back thousands of years, and the home cheese maker can usually find recipes for cheese that falls into any of the four categories.<br>A: Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, bleu, roquefort, mozzarella, meunster and similar cheeses. These cheeses generally pair well with fruit or meats, or can be used as breakfast cheeses in an omelette Nor as pasta fillings. They are usually mildly flavored and very high in moisture.<br>A: American, Colby, co-jack and similar cheeses are inthe semi-soft category. These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a wide range of uses. Co-jack cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterrey jack is one of the most popular. This allows the sharper flavor of Colby to be combined with the milder jack cheese, and also melts better than plain Colby. Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese, and Mexican cheeses such as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming more popular.<br>A: Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and others. Parmesan and Romano are most familiar as the grated powder used to top spaghetti, but they are also used as accompaniments for fruit, wine, nuts and other appetizer items. Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese and melts well, unlike some other hard cheeses.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475994">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475994</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 9 ‐ Summary and<br>Conclusion (C0295)<br>Mr. Ford: Right everyone. I apologize that I can’t show you the marketing campaign today, but next week you will all have the opportunity to see if for yourselves, and I have no doubt that you will be impressed. Let me wrap up the presentation by summarising my key points.<br>Mr. Ford: As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for Alpha computers. The recession is hopefully behind us. It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in the developing markets.<br>Mr. Ford: If we are to succeed in this ultracompetitive field then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs on all levels. As I hope I have illustrated, the x420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs.<br>Mr. Ford: I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new x420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning. Once we establish the x420 in the market we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.<br>Mr. Ford: Alpha computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement. I really see no limit to our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier: quality, excellence and service.<br>Mr. Ford: Before we move on to the Q and A section I’d really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we’ve discussed today, and hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me.<br>Mr. Ford: As the great Henry Ford once said ” Quality means doing it right, when no one is looking” Well, in fact our customers are looking; they are looking for<br>us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot. We cannot let them down!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475996">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475996</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 10 ‐ The Q and A<br>Session (C0298)<br>Jonathan: Well everyone, I’m sure you’d like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really inspirational presentation. Sincere thanks<br>Michael. Jonathan: Now, I’m sure many of you will be keen to ask some questions, so I’d like to open it up a Q and A session. Please raise your hand if you have any questions at all. Janice, go ahead.<br>Janice: Yes thank you Jonathan. I would just like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford made in regards to our competitors, particularly Orange. Now as you know, Orange has established themselves as the market leader in the high-end lap-top market.<br>Janice: How does Mr. Ford expect to compete with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?<br>Mr. Ford: Well Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question. I think you have hit the nail on the head actually. Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and power.<br>Mr. Ford: But, although we can’t compete in terms of size I do believe we hold an advantage in terms of dedication to customer service. Yes, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle,but don’t forget who won that contest.<br>Frank: Ermmm, Mr Ford. Could you elaborate on the actual technical details of the x420 a little more?<br>Mr. Ford: I’d love to but I think we are a little pressed for time right now. However Jonathan has all the technical specs for you on the powerpoint presentation, which you can look over in your own time.<br>Marcie: Mr. Ford. One final question. Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475999">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9475999</a></p>]]>

I can’t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!<br>Mr. Johnson: No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let’s hear more about these chocolates you’re offering.<br>Mr. Smith: Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They’re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many ofthe same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.<br>Mr. Johnson: Hmmm, sounds interesting. . . . gourmet chocolates , where are they produced? Belgium?<br>Mr. Smith: Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.<br>Mr. Johnson: Really? I didn’t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production. . .<br>Mr. Smith: That’s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They’ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!<br>Mr. Johnson: Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, smooth. . . .<br>Mr. Smith: Unique aren’t they? I bet you’ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one’s cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the cr `eme de la cr `eme make it through inspection.<br>Mr. Johnson: Yes, very interesting flavors. . . . . . . Slightly spicy, very unique, that’s for sure. Exactly what ARE the ingredients?<br>Mr. Smith: I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down inthe Granger family for generations. I’m sure you can keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis.<br>Mr. Johnson: Haggis? What’s Haggis?<br>Mr. Smith: It’s a traditional Scottish delicacy; you take sheep’s liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside ofthe sheep’s stomach.<br>Mr. Johnson: Ah, get back to you.<br>Mr. Smith: Mr. Johnson?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Divorce (C0218)<br>Je: Joanne, let’s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is, okay? Let’s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly, so we can go our separate ways, alright?<br>Joanne: Fine with me. I just want to get this over with. It’s important we make a clean break. I should have signed a pre-nup.<br>Je: What was that?<br>Joanne: Nothing! Anyway, you’re right, there’s no reason this has to be nasty. My lawyer tells me you’ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement- I keep the cat and you get the dog. So that’s done. . . . finally.<br>Je: Let’s not go there, Joanne! Ok, so let’s start with the record collection, I’ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.<br>Joanne: Fine, but I’m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.<br>Je: I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne. And you hardly ever use it!<br>Joanne: He’s my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway!<br>Je: Whatever! Alright, I’ll concede the silly gramophone, if you’ll agree that I get the silver tea set.<br>Joanne:How typical, when are you ever going to use a silver tea set? Fine! I don’t want to drag this out any longer than necessary. What’s next? What about these old photographs?<br>Je: Which ones? Let me have a look. Wow, look at that! That brings back memories. . . . That?<br>Joanne:Our trip to Italy! I remember that day. We were going to visit the Trevi fountain, and we got caught in the rain. . . .<br>Je: . . . and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet. I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain. . . .<br>Joanne: Oh, we really did have fun back then didn’t we?<br>Je: Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can’t reconcile and try again? I still love you.<br>Joanne:Oh Jeff! I love you too! I’m so glad we didn’t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.<br>Je: The motorcycle?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐Global View ‐ Carbon Footprint (C0222)<br>A: So what’s your guys’ take on all this global warming hysteria in the media?<br>B: It’s pretty serious, man. There have been tons of scientific studies and the scientific community says that the earth is heating up. We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our planet.<br>A: I don’t know. It sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo if you ask me. ”Save the earth!” The earth will save itself. It’s survived worst disasters in the past. I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies. There’s no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in the winter. And we have no bus system. My house is forty years old and it would take a lot of money to get it refitted to be ”green” and ”energy-efficient”.<br>C: Well I don’t really know if I believe in global warming either, or whether or not it was our doing or a natural change the earth is going through, but you have to admit that we’re living pretty irresponsibly here in the west.<br>A: I guess...<br>C: I think the issue at hand is sustainability. We’ve only got this one earth we can live on, and our resources are quickly disappearing because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything but the present.<br>B: So, like I was saying, we need to change the way we live. We need to reduce our carbon footprint.<br>C: But it doesn’t have to be that drastic. Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now.<br>And we don’t have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either, though it helps.<br>B: I car pool to work everyday with some buddies of mine. I have a rain barrel outside my house I use to water my plants and my lawn in the summer, and I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐Global View ‐ Crime Scene (C0224)<br>Detective MeGee: Alright, Officer McGraw, Give it to me straight, what are we looking at here?<br>McGraw: Detective MeGee! We’re glad to see you! We could sure use your expertise on this one. It’s a break-in, but nothing seems to have been stolen. We received a call from the Bear family at around ten thirty this morning. They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess! Broken chairs and porridge all over the place! Apparently, Momma Bear had made the porridge a little too hot, you see, and they were waiting for it to cool down.<br>Detective MeGee: Okay then, let’s start examining the evidence. . . . Have the forensics team been in yet?<br>McGraw: Yes sir. They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak. Hopefully, they will be able to identify the burglar soon.<br>Detective MeGee: Hmmmm,Ah ha! What’s this? A strand of golden hair. . . . . . this is a very important piece of trace evidence McGraw. It tells me the suspect has long golden hair. . . . . . . very few men have long golden hair. . . . . . . our criminal could be a woman. . . . . .<br>McGraw: A woman? Was she working alone? Did she have an accomplice?<br>Detective MeGee: An accomplice? No, no McGraw, she was definitely working alone. See here, there are footprints in the porridge, here on the floor. . . . footprints, tells me that our suspect is small. . . . could possibly be a child.<br>McGraw: A child? Surely not, sir. . .<br>Detective MeGee: We must follow the clues, McGraw! The evidence doesn’t lie! Now, let’s reconstruct the crime. . . . . . the suspect came in, sat in each chair breaking the smallest one into little pieces. Next, the porridge. she obviously tried to eat it and because it was so hot, she dropped it on the floor. . . . this mess. interesting. These footprints seem to lead upstairs. McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?<br>McGraw: Well, there was no one down here. . . andmaybe we forget to check upstairs.<br>Goldylocks: Hey! What’s with all the noise? I’m trying tosleep up here!<br>Detective MeGee: There she is! Get her!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202241">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202241</a></p>]]>

Jared of course I’ll marry you!<br>A: Oh Babe, I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you! I can’t wait for all the adventures we’re going to have, for all the fights and the laughter. I can’t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you.<br>B: Oh Jared! I can’t wait for our wedding! I hope you don’t mind, but I’ve already chosen a date! Six months from now in the summer! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I’ve had plenty of time to start planning!<br>A: She what?<br>B: Oh don’t worry sweetie, I didn’t know when you were going to propose. It was still a nice surprise! As I was saying, I’ve got it all planned out. There’s almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests<br>attending.<br>A: four hundred?<br>B: No need to sweat it My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be lowbudget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We’ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she’s going to be a professional opera singer?<br>A: Ah...<br>B: And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we’ll get the Youth Group to serve us. I was thinking that your friend’s band could be our entertainment for the night. though they might have to tone it down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your sister’s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what’s their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise- themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine.<br>And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we’ll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake!<br>A: Wow.<br>B: See? It’s going to be wonderful! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of.<br>A: If I survive the next six months.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202244">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202244</a></p>]]>

My usual pair that I’ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape. They don’t provide any support anymore.<br>Salesgirl: Sure, what kind of shoe are you looking for? We’ve got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps, or if you’re looking for something a little more practical, we’ve got Mary Janes, ballerinas.<br>Mom: Show me some classic high heels, please.<br>Salesgirl: Ok, right this way. What color did you have in mind?<br>Mom: Black. Classic.<br>Salesgirl: Of course. We’ve got this style here that is very popular. Because it’s an open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year. They look great on everyone.<br>Mom: Umm. too shiny. And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let’s look for a closed-toe shoe.<br>Salesgirl: Ok, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable.<br>Mom: I don’t like the pointed toes. Let me take a look at what else you have. Too high. That one looks like the back would cut into my heel. I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly. I don’t want bows. I find slingbacks very uncomfortable. Those might as well be stilettos. Too modern. Ah, finally, this is what I’m looking for.<br>Salesgirl: What size?<br>Mom: Seven-and-a-half.<br>Salesgirl: Here we are How does it fit?<br>Mom: Hmmm. not good. They’re too tight. The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it’s pinching my toes. And there’d be no room for my insoles. You know what? I don’t think I have the patience for this today. They just don’t make shoes like they used to. I’ll come back another time.<br>Salesgirl: Have a nice day, Ma’am.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202248">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202248</a></p>]]>

Nice to see you Well, on top the norm, you know, wife and kids and work, I’ve actually gotten into doing some trading.<br>A: Trading? You, big guy? What are you trading?<br>B: Currencies.<br>A: Currencies? As in Euros, Dollars, Pounds and Rupees?<br>B: It’s called Forex. Foreign Exchange. The great thing about it is that I don’t have to invest a huge amount. I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much!<br>A: I don’t understand. You’re buying and selling money?<br>B: You got it! Just last night I made USD 150!<br>A: Last night?<br>B: Yeah! It’s a 24 hour market! I had bought some RMB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RMB at an amazing bid! I’ve also done some trading with CHF and AUD and HKD. I’ve made some good profits but I’ve also suffered some losses. It depends on a lot of factors just like any other market. In total I’ve made about USD 500 in the past few months.<br>A: You’re kidding! I’m on! Where do I sign up?</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202250">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202250</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Trying To Sleep (C0236)<br>Jill: Alex, what’s up with you? You look dreadful!<br>Alex: Hey Jill, I don’t know. I’ve been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks. I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep . I’ve tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed . I’ve tried eating and not eating different foods. I’ve even tried counting sheep! And then when I finally get to sleep , I have these really disturbing nightmares, so I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep .<br>Jill: Wow, maybe you should get that checked out. Maybe you’re stressed?<br>C: Just take some sedatives! Works for me! Every so often having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping . It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders . It’s the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns .<br>Jill: I heard of that. But does that apply to Alex’s situation?<br>C: Ya sure, why not ? Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it’s a recent thing so taking melatonin do the trick.<br>Jill: But shouldn’t he be looking into WHY it’s been happening?<br>C: Well aren’t youthe little psychologist? Our buddy’s having trouble sleeping , it’s easy and curable. It’s not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.<br>Alex: Well, there’s that too.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202253">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202253</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Morning Routine (C0237)<br>Jacob: Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning?<br>Stephanie: It’s a skill. What can I say? I don’t know why, I just have a long routine.<br>Jacob: Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl’s routine be so complicated? You get up , you shower, you get dressed , you brush your teeth, you’re out the door. Half an hour, tops.<br>Stephanie: Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day , I wash my hair. If it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning. In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blowdry it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’s another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.<br>Jacob: True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?<br>Stephanie: Not funny.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202254">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202254</a></p>]]>

I’ve tried to keep it short and clear. If there’s any questions please feel free to ask me.<br>Mr. Parsons: Well yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I’d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.<br>Rebecca: yes of course. Well as you can see from the resume I’m up and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around rook.<br>Mr. Parsons: Ah I see, so you were actually educated in Europe?<br>Rebecca: yes precisely. Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home. But as you see I’ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country. My Father was inthe oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too.<br>Mr. Parsons: Very interesting. So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.<br>Rebecca: Absolutely! We were never still for too long. But now I’m really looking to settle down.<br>Mr. Parsons: I see.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Global View ‐ Learning The Piano (C0242)<br>Charles: Hi Cody, how did practicing go this week?<br>Cody: Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn’t get a chance to memorize the second page, but I think I mastered the tricky section.<br>Charles: Great! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first. Good, good. This week, work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let’s take a look at this tricky section.<br>Cody: Charles? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here?<br>Charles: It might work. I’ll have to hear it . Show me what you’ve done. Not bad , not bad .<br>Cody: It was horrible! I played play it much better at home! Charles: It’s just nerves. Just play the right hand for now. One two three four five six, ta ti tri-ple-ti. Good, good. Don’t forget the accidentals! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it’s a G-natural. Now add the bass clef. You’re going too fast. Remember the tempo for this piece is andante.<br>Cody: Is that better?<br>Charles: Yes, much better. Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal. What was that?<br>Cody: Sorry! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.<br>Charles: That’s ok, keep going, you’re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics! Keep your elbows lifted. Remember to stroke the keys, don’t pound. That’s better! Remember that as a pianist or any other musician, your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202259">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202259</a></p>]]>

I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right?<br>Rebecca: Yes, that’s right. To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me. I was really just treated more like an intern. I didn’t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.<br>Mr. Parsons: So, what changed?<br>Rebecca: Well slowly but surely I proved myself, and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . Mr. Parsons: Wow, a real step up!<br>Rebecca: Yes I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly. I spent restaurant years in that position, but to be honest it wasn’t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term.<br>Mr. Parsons: I see, so why did you decide to leave finally?<br>Rebecca: I just felt that the paper couldn’t offer me any new opportunities.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Weekend ‐ Making A Sandwich (C0249)<br>A: Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started !<br>A: Let’s start with the basics :bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the following<br>criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.<br>A: Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients ! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.<br>A: Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich<br>more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident- cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs- you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.<br>A: Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!<br>A: That’s all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we’ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next time!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202266">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9202266</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary - The Weekend - Scary Story (C0156)</p><p>A: Oh no! The lights went out! Honey can you light a candle? <br>B: Sure. What do we do now? <br>A: Well, we can just talk, you know, like we used to. Hmm... I know! I'll tell you a scary story! It happened to me and my dad when I was a teenager... (fade out - fade in new scene)</p><br>I was living with my father at the time, when he received a phone call. <br>Father: Hello? Yes this is him. I see, I’m sorry to hear that. Ok no problem. I’ll be there shortly. Pack some clothes Tony, my great aunt is very ill and no one in the family wants to take care of her. We are going to stay at her house for a few days. <br>Kid: Aunt? What aunt? I never knew you had a great aunt! <br>Father: Well, the family doesn’t talk about her or get near her, for that matter. <br>Kid: Why is that? <br>Father: Come on, we have to go.<br>So we arrived at this old house on the outskirts of our town. There was almost no one around and the house had an eerie look to it. Once inside the house, we walked to her room and I was surprised to find my dad’s great aunt in a wheelchair, yelling at someone, but we were alone in the room. <br>Father: Hi, aunt Ursula! This is my son Tony. <br>Ursula: Why have you come? Why are you here? Don’t you know it isn’t safe? My time is near, he is coming for me. <br>Kid: Who is coming for you? <br>Ursula: The prince of darkness! The lord of the underworld, the tempter, the old serpent. <br>Father: Come on, aunt Ursula let’s lay you down. You need to get some rest. Tony, help me lay her down.<br>That night, we slept in one of the 12 rooms of that big old mansion. The trees outside seemed to come alive and their shadows formed ghoulish shapes on my bed. All of a sudden, we heard screaming. <br>Ursula: Ahhh! Get off me beast! I won’t let you take me! Ahhh! <br>Kid: Dad! Dad! Dad! Something is attacking aunt Ursula! <br>Ursula: Take your claws off me! Go back to the underworld you demon! I shall be judged before you can take me! <br>Father: The door is jammed! Stand back! Aunt Ursula! Where are you? <br>Kid: Over here! <br><br>And as we approached her, she was lying on the floor, with her hands and feet open like the Vitruvian Man, breathing heavily with bloody marks and scratches on her arms, legs and face. Remember how I mentioned that she was in a wheel chair? My aunt had been paralyzed from the neck down for just over a year. After this incident, strange things would happen in the house and my aunt would yell and scream, according to her, warding off the evil that had come to get her. As the days passed, she became very weak and eventually was unable to talk. My dad had to work during the day, so I was left to care for her. When she lost her voice and laid on her death bed, I would hear her breathe in and out. <br>Until finally one day, she breathed in... and never exhaled. That night, I felt relieved that it was finally over, but it wasn’t. <br><br>I was so terrified of what I was hearing, that I didn’t sleep all night. The following morning, I went to the bathroom,<br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027817">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027817</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Social Security (C0163)<br>A: Well that was an interesting documentary!<br>B: For sure! I didn’t really understand some ofthe technical jargon they used inthe film when they talked about social security in the US.<br>A: Like what?<br>B: Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K?<br>A: Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it inthe plan Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.<br>B: That’s interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have to contribute to a governmentrun retirement fund, but most people don’t really<br>trust itso they just invest in properties or things like that.<br>A: That seems a bit unstable don’t you think?<br>B: Yeah, but corrupt governments inthe past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.<br>A: I’ve been thinking of doing that lately! I don’t want some banker to run off with my money!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027824">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027824</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Apology Letter (C0164)<br>A: Dear Mary, I come here today, in this way, because I need to apologize to you. I failed you. Although I did not lie to you in words, I lied to you with faces that did not belong to me. I never meant to ruin the friendship that meant the world to me. You mean the world to me and now I come to you asking for forgiveness. If in your heart you find you can’t, then I will understand and learn from this experience.<br>A: You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most. We talked about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul could actually<br>feel something other than hurt. You placed comfort where there was fear, confidence where there was doubt, a shoulder where tears could fall and completeness where there was emptiness. I wanted to hold onto to this so badly that I did whatever it took for you to notice. What I didn’t realize was that I could lose my entire being, all of who I was and all that I had placed in you.<br>A: I wanted to be the one who would be there when you needed to talk. I wanted to be the comfort for your soul when the world was too much to handle. I wanted to be strong for you when everything else seemed impossible. I wanted to love you in only the way you deserved to be loved, never realizing that I was destroying myself and you. Somehow I needed you to be a part of my life. The only problem was that I was willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.<br>A: All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me feel were true. Nothing else mattered to me except hearing the laughter in your voice when you were happy. You made my days easy to get through and my nights peaceful; you helped me look forward to another day. Even though distance separated us, just being was enough.<br>A: I’m sorry for hurting you and if I had to do all over again I would have been 100% with you. Forgive me please,</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027825">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027825</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Asking For A Loan (C0165)<br>B: Hello Sir may I help you?<br>A: Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.<br>B: Very well, here arethe general termsof our loan policies. We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate inthe country for personal loans.<br>A: I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let’s say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?<br>B: It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion ofthe loan which is called the principal and another small portion ofthe annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don’t default on a payment!<br>A: It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.<br>B: That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit scorein order to approve your loan.<br>A: You know what? I don’t really need the money. Thanks anyways!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027826">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027826</a></p>]]>

Frankly speaking our household income is relatively high and we have never had any money problems, but I think this isthe main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.<br>B: We have two kids and with allowances, paying their credit cards, ours and not to mention our mortgage and car payments. With the recent economic downturn, my husband’s business has suffered and now we need some advice as to how we can prepare a family budget.<br>A: I see. Well you have come tothe right place. First what we need to do, is determine your cash flow. Knowing how much money is coming in will help us allocate spending to different categories such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.<br>B: Yes that makes sense.<br>A: Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts forthe last two to three months. That way, we can determine what your average expenditures are and see which category you are spending money onthe most. Usually, your fixed costs are higher and we cant do much about that, but we can usually trim your variable costs such as entertainment or clothing.<br>C: Great! We will do that then! Now how about we treat you to a nice dinner?<br>A: That’s another thing. If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit cards!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027834">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027834</a></p>]]>

You can’t just guess peoples’ likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her.

I’m going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself!<br>B: Have you ever written up a business plan before?<br>A: Well, it can’t be that hard! I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that’s it, right?<br>B: You couldn’t be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.<br>A: Well that seems easy enough.</p><p>::  Wait, there’s more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors’? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.<br>A: Geez. Is that all?<br>B: Almost, the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis. Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits. After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment!<br>A: Umm.

I’ve been starving myself for days now and I haven’t lost an ounce!<br>B: Are you trying to lose weight?<br>A: Yeah, my friend is getting married next month and I’m supposed to be a bridesmaid. I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven’t lost any weight! Look at these love handles.<br>B: You don’t have to starve yourself to lose weight. I think that’s where you’re going wrong.<br>A: Why? If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves right?<br>B: Not really. You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts or saturated fats. Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.<br>A: So you are saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat?<br>B: Yes! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol. You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.<br>A: If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks?<br>B: Don’t count on it.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027848">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027848</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary‐Global View ‐ Daylight Savings Time (C0191)<br>A: Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?<br>B: What? Why do we have to do that?<br>A: Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.<br>B: I see. That’s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!<br>A: That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that’s eight time zones east of Greenwich!<br>B: That’s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA! Because of the huge time difference, even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It’s like we went back in time!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027852">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027852</a></p>]]>

This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many, a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world. In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps. Fortunately, no one was injured. Due to to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the US Midwest, causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.<br>Mike: Moving to to Latin American, Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming, but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country. In Chile, a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region. Losses are reported to be in the billions. Authorities have not yet released an official statement.<br>Bob: Not a great week for the world! Any good news?</p><p>Mike: I’m afraid not, Bob. One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region. Meanwhile, Mexico ’s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America,affecting Honduras, Guatemala and Panama.That’s all the new we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the six o’clock news.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary‐Daily Life‐BuildingYourDream Home (C0193)<br>A: Mr. and Mrs. Robinson! Let’s get straight to it. You have saved up your money for years and are now ready to build your dream home. What did you have in mind?<br>B: A suburban bungalow straight out of the sixties! A perfect lawn with minimal landscaping. A brick patio in the backyard with an old-fashioned grill, quaint lawn furniture, and a swimming pool. A two-car carport, pastel siding and a gable roof. Completed with white shutters and a white picket fence !<br>C: Uh, honey?<br>B: In the living room we would have moss-green rugs and a fireplace with a stone mantle and wood paneling on the walls. In the kitchen, the cupboards would be a pale yellow and we would have a turquoise metal oven and vinyl flooring -<br>C: Umm, sweetie, but I was thinking of a more modern style house. An open concept house, all glass, wood, metal, and concrete.<br>B: But sweetums, there is always a lot of wasted space in those kinds of homes. Besides, it’s just a fad. It doesn’t have the homey feeling the old homes do.<br>C: Sweetie-pie it’s not a lot of wasted space. It is relaxing and the house would be eco-friendly with an in-floor heating system and designed to retain the heat of the sun in the winter and keep the house cool in the summer. We would have solar panels on the roof -<br>B: Do you know how much those things cost?<br>C: What about your vintage furniture, dearest? And instead of a lawn, which is also a lot of wasted space and would require environmentally harmful pesticides, we would have a fish pond in the backyard and a garden that would cover the whole yard so we could grow our own food!<br>B: But buttercup, I thought you always said that you loved visiting your grandmother’s house!<br>C: And I thought you, Mr. Scientist, were all up on saving the planet with your technological advancements!<br>A: Umm well I am just going to go get some coffee while you two keep discussing.</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027854">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027854</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Applying CPR (C0198)<br>A: Hello everyone and welcome to our CPR for beginners course. First of all, does anyone know what CPR stands for?<br>B: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation!<br>A: That’s right! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest.<br>B: What does that mean?<br>A: Well, basically if your heart stops pumping blood, or your lungs stop pumping air, then we need to get them going again! That’s when we have to apply this procedure. Let’s begin! I need a volunteer.<br>B: Me! Me!<br>A: Alright, come here and lay flat on your back. Let’s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing. We must lift the person’s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs. Then we place our mouth over the other person’s mouth and blow air two or three times, like this.<br>B: Wait, what are you doing? I’m a married woman! You can’t just try to kiss me like this!<br>A: Ma’ am I’m not trying to kiss you! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency.<br>B: Well, ok. But no French kissing!<br>A: As I was saying, we blow air through the mouth in this manner. Once this is done, we must try to get the heart going again. To do this, we place our hands over the person’s chest, and press down firmly two or three times.<br>B: Wait, what are you doing! You can’t just kiss me then go for second base!</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027859">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027859</a></p>]]>

Where have you been?<br /><br> B: The exams and plans I have to turn in in are driving me crazy, I don’t even have time to sleep.<br /><br> A: It’s the same for me. I’m up to my neck in work, but at least finals are coming soon and we’ll have a vacation. Where are you going now?<br /><br> B: I’m going to Anthropology class and now with the year anniversary of Darwin, it’s the only thing we study. Frankly, I’m sick and tired and tired of hearing about this guy.<br /><br> A: What? Why? How can you not like Darwin? I mean the man changed the entire perception of how things came to and his theory is backed by pretty solid evidence!<br /><br> B: I don’t like him. His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes. It lacks the solid evidence of which you speak of.<br /><br> A: That statement puts you at odds with half of the academy. Not to mention your professors! Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of species and the mechanism of natural selection constitutes a grand step toward a coherent understanding of the world and evolutionist ideas.<br /><br> B: I’m not minimizing his grand contributions, it’s just that his theory reminds of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.<br /><br> A: What are you talking about?<br /><br> B: The question is, which was first? The chicken or the egg? I feel the same regarding his theory. How does the first cell of life come to be?<br /><br> A: Interesting. I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class. In the meantime, how about we settle this... with a due!<br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027812">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/9027812</a></p>]]>

Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it.<br /><br> Tom: I was. It’s just that the holidays are coming up and I won’t be able to home because I can’t afford the airfare. I’m just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom’s cooking and being around my family.<br /><br> Sarah: Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I’d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.<br /><br> Tom: I see what you mean, but I ’m still bummed out.<br /><br> Sarah: Ok how does this sound: let’s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there!<br /><br> Tom: You know, I could really go for that. You don’t mind being my wingman for tonight?<br /><br> Sarah: Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys night out... well kinda...<br /><br> Tom: Great!

			<description><![CDATA[<p> Elementary‐ Global View ‐ Presidential Speech II (C0129)<br> A: We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations. Three of these involved our own country. Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world. We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we realize that America’s leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.<br> A: Throughout America’s adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations.<br> A: We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings; that those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibilities; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; that the scourges of poverty, disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.<br> A: Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen. I am proud to do so. I look forward to it. Thank you, and good night. </p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612558">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612558</a></p>]]>

You seem a bit down.<br> A: I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It’s so hard to talk to him at times.<br> B: Maybe it’s just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.<br> A: Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what’s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off.<br> B: Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.<br> A: I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn’t always this grouchy you know...<br> B: Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn’t work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!<br> A: You are something else you know that? </p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612564">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612564</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p> Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Gambling (C0136)<br> A: Did you hear? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business!<br> B: Are you serious? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me.<br> A: What are you talking about? How does it exploit people?<br> B: Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.<br> A: Geez! Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn’t such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn’t become addicted or anything like that.<br> B: You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize! </p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612565">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612565</a></p>]]>

Daddy is going to teach you how to play!<br> Bobby: Cool!<br> Daddy: Ok, each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I’ll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.<br> Bobby: What about all these other pieces?<br> Daddy: See this one that looks like a tower? It’s called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it’s a very important piece so it’s best to not let your opponent capture it.<br> Bobby: And these two? They are husband and wife?<br> Daddy: That’s right! That’s the queen and that’s the king. If the other player captures your king, he will say ”Check Mate” and the game is over! Doesn’t this sound fun?<br> Bobby: Nah! This is boring!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Capital Punishment (C0144)<br>ProfeTsshoar: It’s all for today’s class. We will continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.<br>A: Do you think we should be tougher on crime?<br>B: Well, it depends on what you mean.<br>A: For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences for lesser offences and lock up juvenile offenders.<br>B: Those really sound like Draconian measures. Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you’ve already put innocent people to death?<br>A: You’d only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you’d convicted the right person.<br>B: But, there’ve been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years. The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable. In some cases, it’d been fabricated by the police.<br>A: Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there’s a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.<br>B: I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low. The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they’re going to be caught. It doesn’t make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.<br>A: But if you detect more crimes, you’ll still need prisons. In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they’d learn that they couldn’t get away with it. Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.<br>B: Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals. To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.<br>A: Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment. I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.<br>B: You sound like a dictator!<br>A: Well if it works, why not?</p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612573">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612573</a></p>]]>

If they are going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.<br>A: Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.<br>B: I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights. If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.<br>A: You cant compare apples and oranges; I believe that both topics are important and that we cant ignore them, the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.<br>B: Well, you are right on that point. This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.<br>B: At least you're doing your part.

Next time I’m picking the film, because I don’t want to end up seeing a chick flick.<br> B: Well you should have picked, in the end you always complain about everything.<br> A: Not everything, just this film. Even the title is ridiculous; and it’s so long, those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life, so much so that I’m thinking about asking them to give me my money back.<br> B: I’m thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you’re always so negative.<br> A: I’m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.<br> B: You see, that’s what I’m talking about, I can’t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore<br> A: Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.<br> B: Well he’s more of a man than you are; at least he appreciates love stories.<br> A: Love? More like one-night-stands.<br> B: Don’t criticize Mario or else I’ll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours; they’re no saints.<br> A: My friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends?<br> B: You’re unbearable; you can walk home, I’m leaving. </p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612576">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612576</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Global Warming (C0102)<br /><br> A: And therefore, global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century. Questions?<br /><br> B: Uh, yeah. In the lecture you said there's more evidence in the scientific record supporting global cooling?<br /><br> A: Well, yes, essentially, the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles. Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the planetary eco-system.<br /><br> B: If that's true and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?<br /><br> A: But are global temperatures rising? If you look at the data from nineteen seventy-five you'll...<br /><br> B: You'll be misled. If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s. Then you would see how dramatically the earths temperature has changed.<br /><br> A: Young lady, I beg to differ. Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there is evidence for both sides, and I’m putting forth the argument that there’s greater evidence in support of the global cooling hypothesis. Look, it’s an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into believing theres some kind of climate crisis; this scaremongering is done, quite simply, for political reasons.<br /><br> B: But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?<br /><br> A: Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.<br /><br> B: Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species and investing in renewable energy. At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence on foreign oil. Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.<br /><br> A: Why, I've never been so disrespected in all of my days. I’m a professor, a scientist and researcher of high regard.<br /><br> B: Yeah, and a duplicitous one at that. Everyone knows you're in the pocket of the oil lobby. Why should we trust your so-called findings more than tobacco institute studies which say smoking doesn't harm health? You're full of it.<br /><br> A: Some people just cannot handle civil debate<br /><br> <br /><br><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612531">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612531</a></p>]]>

What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado where the sun is shinning, and we’ve got twelve<br /><br> inches of fresh powder. It doesn’t get much better than this.<br /><br> A: That’s right, Bob, but today we have a special treat for our viewers. We’re joined here by Ian Roussy, the<br /><br> four-time giant slalom champion. And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing! So, let’s hit the slopes!<br /><br> C: Well, first off, let’s get those boots on. You’re going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly. That’s right; now snap them into your bindings. And you’re also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes. It’s a bright day today, so there’s going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes. We don’t want you hitting any of thosemoguls!<br /><br> A: Bob, since you’re a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it is a good idea to have a good warm pair of dry ski<br /><br> gloves.<br /><br> C: Easy there, Rick! Well, let’s head on over to the chairlift, and test your skills! All right, we’re up here on<br /><br> the bunny hill, so, Bob, why don’t you do a few snow-plow turns. Gnarly run, Rick! Nice carving! You’ve got some mad skills! That was sick!<br /><br> A: You wanna see gnarley? Well, see that bump over there, I’m going to catch some major air.<br /><br> C: Butt plant!<br /><br> B: Ha ha ha! He lost his skis! Yard sale!!!<br /><br> A: Ahem, well. Thanks for joining us here today, I think that about does it. Bob, Ian, time for some après-ski?<br /><br> C: No way, man!

How are things looking for us in terms of sales this month?<br /><br> B: Uh well...would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?<br /><br> A: What? Ed, don’t tell me you only have bad news!<br /><br> B: Well sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, fifty percent in the past month alone. We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits are falling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It’s a real mess.<br /><br> A: For crying out loud... How fast are we losing money?<br /><br> B: Um...how can I put this? Let’s just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months.<br /><br> A: What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what’s the bad news?<br /><br> B: Oh, that’s the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty. We’re going to have to recall all items sold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We’re going to have to shoulder this cost.<br /><br> A: Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume the costs of this mess!<br /><br> B: We tried that, sir. The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.<br /><br> A: We’re doomed!<br /><br> B: There is some really good news though!<br /><br> A: Really? What!<br /><br> B: I got offered a new job!<br /><br> <br /><br><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612537">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612537</a></p>]]>

What’s on your mind?<br /><br> A: We need to talk.<br /><br> B: Okay...<br /><br> A: I’ve been thinking, and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.<br /><br> B: What? Why? I mean, we’ve had our ups and downs, and we have the occasional disagreement, but we’re happy together, aren’t we?<br /><br> A: That’s just it, I’m not happy anymore, Tim. It’s not you, it’s me. I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for!<br /><br> B: So, what are you saying? You’re breaking up with me because I’m perfect?<br /><br> A: Tim, you are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say that I’ll be all you need, but that would be a lie. I know I’d only hurt you, I know I’d only make you cry.<br /><br> B: Baby, come on. Don’t do this to me! Whatever it is, we can work it out. Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick together! Don’t leave me.<br /><br> A: I can’t, Tim. I hope someday you can find some way to understand I’m only doing this for you. I don’t really wanna go but, deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do.<br /><br> B: Laura...<br /><br> A: Here are your keys. I’ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week. I’m sorry, Tim. I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again. I’ll always love you. Goodbye.<br /><br> <br /><br><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612538">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612538</a></p>]]>

My name is Rick Fields, and you guessed it, I am here with my main man, Bob Copeland.<br /><br> B: Thank you, Rick! As you can see, ladies and gentleman, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars!<br /><br> A: Whoa, that’s a lot of cash! Let’s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.<br /><br> B: All right, were’re here at the eighth hole. It’s a par four, and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid. Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole!<br /><br> A: Tiger Woods is about to tee off, and let’s see if he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, he seems to be very nervous.<br /><br> B: Oh no! Not a good swing at all! It’s definitely not his day today. On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par. He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.<br /><br> A: It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees. He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it.<br /><br> B: Oh no! A bear! Run, Tiger, run! Somebody call animal control!<br /><br> <br /><br><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612540">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612540</a></p>]]>

This old house is falling apart! Come on into the bathroom. See, here, there’s water leaking everywhere! <br /><br> A: I see. Let me have a look. It seems that your toilet is clogged, and that’s why i won’t flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that’s not working either. I suspect that there’s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that’s causing a blockage. That’s what’s making your toilet overflow.<br /><br> B: Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always flushing things down the toilet. You know how kids are.<br /><br> A: Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. That could be causing water to not drain completely; that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn’t shutting off properly. I could have it all finished by today if it’s urgent.<br /><br> B: That would be great! Is it expensive?<br /><br> A: Let’s see... I would say about eight hundred dollars.<br /><br> B: What?

			<description><![CDATA[Elementary‐The Office‐You MissedTheDeadline! (C0116)<br /><br> A: And so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project. As you know, you’ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team’s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.<br /><br> B: I know, I’m really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn’t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analyis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my deadline.<br /><br> A: Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You’re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.<br /><br> B: No, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn’t gone down. And you know, with everything I’ve got going on now, I can’t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I’ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day...<br /><br> A: I’m not going to accept this excuse. You’re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you’ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney excuses. If you’re in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by 9 am!<br /><br> <br /><br><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612545">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612545</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Elementary - Global View - Presidential Speech (C0121)</p><p>A: Good evening, my fellow Americans. Three days from now, after a half-century of service of our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities of office as, in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor. This evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.<br>A: Like every other citizen, I wish the new President, and all who will labor with him, Godspeed. I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.<br>A: Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our great nation. My own relations with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point. I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationship with Congress during the war and immediate post-war period. Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we’ve had during these past eight years. </p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612550">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8612550</a></p>]]>

It’s all math, really; arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.<br> B: Yeah, yeah, but today’s lesson was all about the creation of the universe.<br> A: A physics class about the creation of the universe? That’s some pretty unscientific language there. Sounds more religious to me.<br> B: It’s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.<br> A: Turtles? Whatever... Look, all that’s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that’s what the math says.<br> B: Math, shmath. What’s the evidence?<br> A: There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He’s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang... DUH!<br> B: Anyway, it’s just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where’s the scientific rigor in that?<br> A: Dude, don’t equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, didn’t you?<br> B: Agh! You’re making my head hurt again! Quit with the questions! </p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8417500">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8417500</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[<p> Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Movie Review (C0099)<br> A: Welcome back movie lovers to another ” Premier Movie Review”. My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson.<br> B: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie ” Lion King”. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?<br> A: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man’s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it’s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.<br> B: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.<br> A: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It’s a G-rated movie! It’s for the kids! It’s not a thriller!<br> B: Well, that’s just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it’s his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It’s just too cliché.<br> A: How can it be cliché? It’s a fable! It’s telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.<br> B: You have always been so soft, Dave!<br> A: Open your heart Dick. Don’t shut us out.<br> B: Anyway... That’s all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about "How to lose a guy in 10 days" I’m sure you’ll love that one Dave! </p><br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8417505">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8417505</a></p>]]>

Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration, with a specialization in Information Management, and I minored in psychology. I chose this course of study for two reasons: I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills, which the information management track provided, and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence the minor in psychology.<br> A: Interesting. And, your postgraduate studies?<br> B: Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a master’s in that area. I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service.<br> A: Very good.

Now, I have a couple of final questions.<br> B: I hope they’re not too hard!<br> A: Well, why should we hire you?<br> B: I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company. I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen, and outstanding soft skills; you know, I excel at building strong, long-term customer relationships. For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team solved about seventy percent of our customers’ problems. I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products, so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers’ issues. Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.<br> A: Impressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?<br> B: To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management. Punctuality has never been a strength of mine. I find it hard to organize my time efficiently. I have actually addressed this weakness recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I’m getting better now.<br> A: Great... Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview. We are short-listing our candidates this week, and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.<br> B: Great, thanks a lot! I hope to hear from you! Good bye.<br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8417471">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8417471</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[Elementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ International Workers Day (C0078)<br> A: Alright everyone settle down. Let’s get started. As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings me to our topic for today. Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first?<br> B: Cinco de mayo?<br> A: No, that’s May fifth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May first is International Workers’ Day.<br> B: Do we get a day off from school then?<br> A: No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.<br> B: Aww, man!<br> A: In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.<br> B: Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?<br> A: Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.<br> B: And then what happened?<br> A: Well, as we say, the rest is history...<br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8417484">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/8417484</a></p>]]>

			<description><![CDATA[Elementary ‐ Advanced ‐ Just In Time Strategy (E0047)<br> A: I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan. As I’m sure you’re all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global financial crisis, we’re obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods. We don’t want to have to be looking at redundancies. So, we’ve outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.<br> B: We have two basic points that we want to focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.<br> C: Why would want to do that? I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.<br> B: Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead timesfor better overall efficiency.<br> A: Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.<br> C: I see. That makes sense.<br> B: The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.<br> C: I’m with you on this one. Its essential that we reduce these errors; we’ve got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.<br> A: Exactly. Well, let’s look at how we’re going to put this plan into action. First...(fade out)<br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/7194864">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/7194864</a></p>]]>

And I’ll think about the impact this will have on our clients. Hey, what about vaccines? Should we be thinking about getting vaccines for our employees?<br> A: Exactly right.

			<description><![CDATA[Elementary ‐Advanced ‐ Investing in Emerging Markets (E0029)<br> A: Dad, I’d like to borrow some money.<br> B: Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? five bucks?<br> A: Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna get into the market. You know, I’m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity. This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.<br> B: I don’t know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don’t know if you’re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There’s just too much instability. I wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this climate.<br> A: But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I’m not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods rePresents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.<br> B: Come on, son, you’re looking at this too naively, the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.<br> A: Fine, then! If that’s the way you feel, so be it. But you’re losing out on a great opportunity here. I’m going to go hit up Mum for the cash.<br /><br /><p>查看节目原文：<br /><a href="https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/6909552">https://www.ximalaya.com/album/403231/6909552</a></p>]]>

Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry! Sir, sir, Sarah O’Connell, Action 5 news. Can you tell us what’s happening?<br> B: Yeah, yeah, we’re here because we feel this is an injustice! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop! We’re here to show the government that we don’t like the way that they’re spending our tax dollars!<br> A: Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry?<br> B: It’s an absolute outrage, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers’ money to the auto industry. These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.<br> A: I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.<br> B: That maybe true, and I for one don’t want to see anyone lose their job, but how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they’re making millions of dollars? And then, they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars! And they’re asking for money! That is just not right!<br> A: Good point.
